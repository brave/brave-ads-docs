<p><em>Last Updated: March 11, 2024</em></p>
<p>These Brave Search Advertiser Terms of Service (<em>&quot;Terms&quot;</em>) apply to your access to and use of Services (as defined in Section 1 below) provided by Brave US LLC and any of its affiliated companies, including but not limited to direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries and otherwise commonly owned or affiliated companies.  (<em>&quot;Brave&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;we&quot;</em>). You also agree that these Terms will apply to any claims asserted against any employee, director, officer or agent of Brave. <strong>By accessing or using our Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in Section 13, do not access or use our Services.</strong></p>
<p>For information about how we collect and use your data, please refer to our <a href="https://brave.com/privacy/advertiser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advertisers Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:advertisers@brave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advertisers@brave.com</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-overview-and-scope">1. Overview and Scope<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Overview and Scope" title="Direct link to 1. Overview and Scope" href="/advertiser-policies/search-terms#1-overview-and-scope">​</a></h2>
<p>Brave operates a platform (the <em>&quot;Platform&quot;</em>) for delivering ads to users of the Brave Search Engine, a proprietary search engine owned and operated by Brave Software, Inc.
These Terms govern the services (the <em>&quot;Services&quot;</em>) that Brave makes available to advertisers who establish an Advertiser Account with Brave (<em>&quot;Brave Advertisers&quot;</em>), including the ability to place advertisements and obtain related services through the Platform.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-eligibility">2. Eligibility<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Eligibility" title="Direct link to 2. Eligibility" href="/advertiser-policies/search-terms#2-eligibility">​</a></h2>
<p>In order to access and use our Services, you must</p>
<ul>
<li>be at least 18 years of age and have the capacity to enter into a legally binding agreement,</li>
<li>use our Services only for business purposes, and</li>
<li>establish an Advertiser Account in accordance with Section 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not access or use our Services if</p>
<ul>
<li>you are prohibited by law from using the Services or do not have the requisite licenses or other governmental authorizations to use the Services,</li>
<li>you or your country is on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties or countries, or</li>
<li>your use of the Services breaches any other agreement to which you are a party.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of another person or entity: references to <em>&quot;you&quot;</em> in these Terms collectively refer to you and that person or entity, and you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity&#x27;s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-advertiser-account">3. Advertiser Account<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Advertiser Account" title="Direct link to 3. Advertiser Account" href="/advertiser-policies/search-terms#3-advertiser-account">​</a></h2>
<p>You can request to establish an Advertiser Account with us by joining <a href="https://ads.brave.com/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ads.brave.com/search</a>. You will need to provide us information to establish an Advertiser Account (<em>&quot;Account Information&quot;</em>), including your name and email address. We may ask for additional Account Information at our discretion. The Account Information you provide must be true and accurate. You must promptly inform us whenever your Account Information changes.
When you establish your Advertiser Account, we may provide you with information related to the Services which is confidential, and you agree to keep such information confidential. You have confidentiality obligations with respect to this information and these obligations are described in Section 7.
You must maintain the security of your Advertiser Account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Advertiser Account without your permission. If you permit others to use your Advertiser Account, you are responsible for the activities of such people that occur in connection with your Advertiser Account. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact information for your Advertiser Account.
If you wish to delete or deactivate your Advertiser Account, you may do so according to Section 16, but note that we may retain certain information as permitted by law, regulation or court order.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-advertising-content">4. Advertising Content<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Advertising Content" title="Direct link to 4. Advertising Content" href="/advertiser-policies/search-terms#4-advertising-content">​</a></h2>
<p>You alone are responsible for the ads submitted for the Platform on your Advertiser Account (<em>&quot;your ads&quot;</em>). You must ensure that your ads are truthful, not misleading, comply with all applicable laws, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence. Your ads must conform to our ad policy (<em>&quot;Ad Policy&quot;</em>), which we provide to you when you establish your Advertiser Account and which is incorporated into these terms. The Ad Policy includes a list of the geographic regions in which Brave Ads are intended to be shown. We may update the Ad Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to review these changes to the Ad Policy on an ongoing basis.
You must accurately label your ads with the region(s) in which they are to be shown, and the subject of each of your ads must be legal to advertise, sell, and use in all of the regions with which you label that ad, as well as in the USA, the state of California, and the Cayman Islands.
Your ads are subject to review and approval by us before they are activated for delivery in the Platform. We may also review your ads at any point and for any reason. If your ads for any reason do not pass our approval process, or are otherwise deemed to be in violation of these Terms, we may — at our discretion — disable those ads, immediately halt all of your ads, suspend you from the platform, or apply other remedies we think are needed to ensure the quality and reputation of the Platform. Our determination in these matters, including as to which Content Classifications apply to any of your ads, is final and binding.
You grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to Brave to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, and modify (as needed for display on the Platform) your ads for the purpose of displaying your ads via the Platform and otherwise providing the Services to you under these Terms.
Brave reserves the right to suspend campaigns at any time if Brave suspects that the advertiser campaign poses a safety risk to our users including if Brave suspects that the advertising company has a security breach/incident and/or other significant operational failures, provided that Brave will provide as much notice to Advertiser as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances prior to suspending a campaign.
Campaign performance may vary and is not guaranteed by Brave.</p>

<p>Your ads are priced based on the number of clicks (<em>“Clicks”</em>) the ad generates and the cost per click (<em>“CPC”</em>), which is the amount you agree to pay us for each click you receive. The CPC is based either on a fixed price agreed upon between you and us or on a competitive bidding process that takes place at the time an ad is to be served in response to a relevant query. When the Platform displays one of your ads and a user clicks on the ad, it reports that Click to us. Approximately every month, we verify and tally the Clicks and CPC associated with all of your active ad campaigns and issue you an invoice. Our accounting of Clicks and CPC is final and binding. You agree to pay the full amount of each invoice within 30 days of receipt.</p>

<p>You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Services, and for withholding, collecting, reporting and remitting the correct taxes, if any, to the appropriate tax authorities. Brave is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any tax arising from your use of the Services. You agree to provide information reasonably requested by Brave, including completed and signed tax forms, as applicable.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-confidentiality">7. Confidentiality<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7. Confidentiality" title="Direct link to 7. Confidentiality" href="/advertiser-policies/search-terms#7-confidentiality">​</a></h2>
<p>In the course of your use of the Services, we may disclose to you information which we consider confidential (<em>&quot;Confidential Information&quot;</em>), including information regarding your pricing and performance measures.
You agree to use this Confidential Information solely for the purpose of using the Platform and to keep this Confidential Information secret, using no less than the same degree of care that you use when you protect your own similar confidential information, and in any event at least a reasonable degree of care.</p>
