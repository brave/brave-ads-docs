# Search ads

**This product is currently only available to enterprise customers who meet a minimum set of criteria. Please contact adsales@brave.com to inquire.** <br /><br />
Brave Search is the default search engine in the Brave browser and the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Search ads display when a user enters queries that match advertiser keywords that are generated based on the advertiser’s website. For example, if a user enters the query “blue shoes”, an ad will be shown from an advertiser who sells shoes on their website. If there is no relevant ad for the query, an organic result will be shown instead.

### Overview

All ads are created automatically based on landing page content to ensure an ideal user experience. When an ad shows on Brave Search, it’s because a keyword that matches the content of an advertiser landing page is a sufficient match. For both the user and advertiser this is the ideal outcome: the user finds what they are looking for, and the advertiser gets the user to their website.

### Ad requirements

- The domain that you will be sending traffic to (for example: https://brave.com or https://wikipedia.org)
- Your email address must match this domain (for example: user@brave.com or user@wikipedia.org)
- Query string parameters (optional but recommended)

### Pricing
