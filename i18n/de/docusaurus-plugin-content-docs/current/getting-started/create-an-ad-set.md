# Create an ad set

After you’ve set basic parameters for your campaign, you’ll need to further define the targeting and delivery parameters of your ads. You can set up multiple ad sets within a campaign, for example, when you wish to target different ads to different device types or contextual segments. The ad set level is where you will set the following parameters:

- **Ad set names** will help to identify ad sets more easily in your account.
- **Categories** are contextual segments based on the IAB standard taxonomy. They determine what type of interests you’d like to target with your ad set.
- **Platforms** define what types of devices your ad will be delivered to.
