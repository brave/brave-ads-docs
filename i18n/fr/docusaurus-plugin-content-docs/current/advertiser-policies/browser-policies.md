# Brave Browser Advertiser Terms of Services

## Policies

- [IAB standard terms & conditions](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IAB_4As-tsandcs-FINAL.pdf)
- [Advertiser privacy policy](https://brave.com/privacy/advertiser/)
- [Basic Attention Token terms of service](https://basicattentiontoken.org/advertiser-terms-of-service/)

## Website and page requirements

- Advertiser website must be accessible and fully functional.
- Advertiser website must have Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy.
- Advertiser website must be in the same language as both the ads and the primary language(s) of the country or region(s) targeted by ad campaigns, and/or have options to translate content upon arrival.

## Redirect links

Advertisers cannot use redirecting links unless it's within the same eTLD+1. Any link that redirects to another domain, even if owned by the same advertiser, will be rejected.

**Examples of redirects which will be rejected:**

- `https://landing.brave.me` Redirects to: `https://brave.com/landing`
     - Assuming they are both owned by Brave, this would still be denied since they are not on the same eTLD+1.
- `https://brave.page.link/abc` - which redirects `https://brave.com/landing`

**Examples of redirects that will be accepted:**

- `https://brave.com/marketing` redirecting to `https://ads.brave.com`
- `https://landing.brave.com` redirecting to `https://brave.com`

## Brand safety

All Brave ads are brand safe in that they are served first-party at the browser or search-engine level, not before, between, or after content on explicit or potentially unsafe third-party websites.

### Extended policy for CBD advertising

This article covers the policy for advertising CBD products with Brave Ads in the United States. Brave Ads may support CBD advertising outside of the United States in the future, but currently only supports advertising CBD within the United States. This document only applies for CBD advertising, and does not apply to THC-related products.  Advertising for “CBD flower”, “CBD wraps” or any CBD products used for smoking is prohibited. Advertisements cannot click-through to landing pages that feature THC products for sale alongside the CBD product being advertised.

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into US federal law, removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. However, the legal status of CBD varies from state to state. The guidelines below (which are provided for reference only and should not be relied upon by any advertisers) cover where CBD advertisers can advertise their products in Brave Ads, and applicable conditions per state.

Advertisers accept full liability and responsibility for operating within state regulations and restrictions for the states that they plan to run CBD advertising in.

You represent and warrant that your CBD advertisements (including any products, services or other materials referenced therein), any website(s) or other destinations to which your advertisements may link or direct viewers, and any act or omission by you relating to your CBD advertisements (collectively, “CBD Advertisements”) do not violate any applicable law, statute, directive, ordinance, treaty, contract, or regulation, or any applicable Brave policies or guidelines, in any of the jurisdictions in which your CBD Advertisements are distributed and/or displayed.

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Brave and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents from and against all claims, demands, suits, or other assertions of rights by any third party, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Claims”), and any resulting judgments, damages, losses, liabilities, settlements, costs, and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and costs), that arise out of or in connection with your CBD Advertisements. You agree to be solely responsible for defending any Claim against Brave and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and agents, subject to Brave’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing; provided, that you will not agree to any settlement without Brave’s prior written consent.
