# Billing

Brave Ads are available to be purchased via various different pricing models. By default, all ad campaigns globally will be billed in USD, however, other options are available.

| **Pricing model** | **Billable event (if applicable)**                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Flat**          | A flat rate, also referred to as a fixed rate, refers to a static fee regardless of delivery or performance. Flat rates are currently only used for New Tab Takeovers. |
| **CPM**           | Refers to a cost-per-thousand impressions, whereby the advertiser is billed a fixed price for each thousand impressions delivered by their campaign.                                   |
| **CPC**           | Refers to a cost-per-click, whereby the advertiser is billed based on a fixed price for each individual click delivered by their campaign.                                             |

The pricing model is determined at the ad set level of the campaign and cannot be changed partway through a flight. In order to switch an ad set to a new pricing model, the original ad set must be paused, and a new one with the revised pricing model must be created. The original ad set will be billed according to the original pricing.

## Paying an invoice

By default, invoices for managed campaigns are sent at the end of the monthly billing cycle for the calendar month. Payment is due within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. Brave may, at our discretion, require pre-payment for advertisers and campaigns prior to the launch of their campaign

## Paying with a credit card

Both Managed Service and self-directed Brave Ads Manager campaigns can be paid by credit card via Stripe. 

- If buying via Managed Service, simply let your account manager know you’d like to pay via credit card.
- If buying via Brave Ads Manager, you will be asked to pre-pay for your campaign by “topping-up” your account via Stripe.

## Paying with cryptocurrency

Both Managed Service and self-directed Brave Ads Manager campaigns can be paid by using a crypto wallet via Radom.

- If buying ads via Managed Service, simply let your account manager know you’d like to pay via cryptocurrency. Please note that we currently accept Basic Attention Token (BAT), USD Coin (USDC), and Tether USD (USDT) on the Ethereum blockchain.
- If buying ads via Brave Ads Manager, you will be asked to pre-pay for your campaign by “topping-up” your account via Radom.

## Cancellations

For New Tab Takeovers, advertisers that cancel within seven days of the campaign launch date will be charged 50% of the campaign cost. 

If working with our accounts and sales team, you can cancel your Search, Notifications, or Newsfeed ads campaigns at any time and will only be invoiced for the amounts spent up until the campaign was paused. 

If you prepaid your campaign via our self-service option and wish to cancel your campaign early, please note that you’ll need to request a refund for any remaining balance by sending an email to [selfserve@brave.com](mailto:selfserve@brave.com).

# Account balances

Any leftover campaign budgets from pre-paid campaigns paid via Stripe or Radom will be transferred to your account balance for future campaigns. These funds are typically transferred within 24-48 hours, under the following two circumstances:

### When a campaign reaches its end date

If your campaign reaches its scheduled end date and there are remaining funds, the campaign status will update to "complete," and any leftover funds will be transferred to your account balance.

### When a campaign is terminated manually

To end your campaign immediately and transfer any remaining funds to your account balance, follow these steps:

- Select the campaign.
- Click "Edit."
- Click "Close this campaign."
