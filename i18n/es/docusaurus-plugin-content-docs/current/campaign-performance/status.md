# Indicadores de estado

Todas las campañas y anuncios en el Administrador de Anuncios de Brave mostrarán un indicador en la columna "estado" para ayudar a identificar su estado actual. Para que una campaña y sus anuncios se publiquen, el Administrador de Anuncios de Brave comprobará el estado de cada nivel en este orden:

1. Estado de la campaña
2. Estado del conjunto de anuncios
3. Estado del anuncio

Solo cuando los tres estén en estado activo, se publicarán los anuncios.

## Estados de la campaña

| **Estado**        | **Descripción**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Borrador**      | The campaign is being set up and will not be active until submitted to the Brave team. Drafts can be returned-to at a later time, or deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Bajo revisión** | The campaign is in Brave’s review queue, where it will be reviewed by a member of our team before delivery can begin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Activo**        | The campaign is ready to start delivering ads when it is within its scheduled run dates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Pausado**       | The campaign is paused and not delivering ads, but it remains within its scheduled run dates and has remaining budget to spend and is thus eligible to be reactivated.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Día completo**  | The campaign has spent its daily budget and is paused until the following day. Daily budgets are set automatically based on the campaign’s total budget to help pace delivery through the full flight of the campaign.                                                                                                               |

| **Suspendido**    | The campaign has been paused by a member of Brave’s team either for violating terms of service, invoice delinquency, or other administrative reasons. To resolve the suspension, it may be required to edit and resubmit the campaign, or you may need to contact our support team: selfserve@brave.com |
