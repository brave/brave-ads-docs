# Status indicators

All campaigns and ads in Brave Ads Manager will display an indicator in the “status” column to help identify their current state. In order for a campaign and its ads to run, Brave Ads Manager will check the status of each level in this order:

1. Campaign status
2. Ad set status
3. Ad status

Only when all three are in an active state, will ads deliver.

## Campaign states

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Draft**|The campaign is being set up and will not be active until submitted to the Brave team. Drafts can be returned-to at a later time, or deleted.|
|**Under review**|The campaign is in Brave’s review queue, where it will be reviewed by a member of our team before delivery can begin.|
|**Active**|The campaign is ready to start delivering ads when it is within its scheduled run dates.|
|**Paused**|The campaign is paused and not delivering ads, but it remains within its scheduled run dates and has remaining budget to spend and is thus eligible to be reactivated.|
|**Daycomplete**|The campaign has spent its daily budget and is paused until the following day. Daily budgets are set automatically based on the campaign’s total budget to help pace delivery through the full flight of the campaign.|
|**Completed**|The campaign has either reached its scheduled end date or exhausted its budget, and is no longer delivering ads.|
|**Suspended**|The campaign has been paused by a member of Brave’s team either for violating terms of service, invoice delinquency, or other administrative reasons. To resolve the suspension, it may be required to edit and resubmit the campaign, or you may need to contact our support team: selfserve@brave.com|

## Ad set states
| **State** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Active** | The ad set is ready to start delivering ads when it is within its scheduled run dates.  |
| **Paused** | The ad set is paused and not delivering ads, but it remains within its scheduled run dates and has remaining budget to spend and is thus eligible to be reactivated. |

## Ad states

| **State** | **Description** |  |
|---|---|---|
| **Draft** | The ad is being set up and will not be active until submitted to the Brave team. Drafts can be returned-to at a later time, or deleted. |
| **Under review** | The ad is in Brave’s review queue, where it will be reviewed by a member of our team before it is eligible to be served. |
| **Active** | The ad is eligible to be served by the campaign, if the campaign itself is also active. |
