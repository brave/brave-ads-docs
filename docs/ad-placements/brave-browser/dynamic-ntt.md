# Dynamic NTT

### Dynamic NTT (Rich media) specifications

Dynamic NTTs use custom HTML5 elements to craft interactive ad experiences on the new tab page. 

In order to manage the integrity of the new tab page and prevent confusion with existing interface elements of the browser, Brave manages the creation of each experience in-house using the standard assets delivered for the Static NTT described above. Each Dynamic NTT campaign is created starting with one of our pre-built templates:

1. **Carousel**: 

    a. Up to three background images that change every three seconds, with arrows that users can click to cycle through the images manually.
2. **Slider**: 

    a. Two overlaid images with an interactive slider that lets users slide between them, revealing and hiding content based on the placement of the slider.

To meet our user privacy requirements, fonts are limited to a set that are available natively across all supported platforms.
