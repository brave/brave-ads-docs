- [IAB standard terms & conditions](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IAB_4As-tsandcs-FINAL.pdf)

## Restricted and prohibited categories
Campaigns cannot currently advertise products and services for the following prohibited and restricted categories:
- CBD (available in the US with state-level restrictions)
- THC
- Tobacco
- Vaping
- Pharmaceuticals
- Gambling
- Adult content
- Politics
- Violence
- Content targeting children

Note: While currently unavailable, advertising to restricted categories may become available in the future.

## Website and page requirements
- Advertiser website must have Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy.
- Advertiser website must be accessible and fully functional.
- Advertiser website must be in the same language as both the ads and the primary language(s) of the country or region(s) targeted by ad campaigns, and/or have options to translate content upon arrival.

## Redirect links
Advertisers cannot use redirecting links unless it's within the same eTLD+1. Any link that redirects to another domain, even if owned by the same advertiser, will be rejected.

**Examples of redirects which will be rejected:**
- `https://landing.brave.me` Redirects to: `https://brave.com/landing`
    - Assuming they are both owned by Brave, this would still be denied since they are not on the same eTLD+1.
- `https://brave.page.link/abc` - which redirects `https://brave.com/landing`

**Examples of redirects that will be accepted:**
- `https://brave.com/marketing` redirecting to `https://ads.brave.com` 
- `https://landing.brave.com` redirecting to `https://brave.com` 

## Brand safety
All Brave ads are brand safe in that they are served first-party at the browser or search-engine level, not before, between, or after content on explicit or potentially unsafe third-party websites.
