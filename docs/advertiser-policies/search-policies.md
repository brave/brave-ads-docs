For information about how we collect and use your data, please refer to our [Advertisers Privacy Policy](https://brave.com/privacy/advertiser/).

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at advertisers@brave.com.

You and Brave agree as follows:

## 1. Overview and Scope
Brave operates a platform (the *"Platform"*) for delivering ads to users of the Brave Search Engine, a proprietary search engine owned and operated by Brave Software, Inc.
These Terms govern the services (the *"Services"*) that Brave makes available to advertisers who establish an Advertiser Account with Brave (*"Brave Advertisers"*), including the ability to place advertisements and obtain related services through the Platform.

## 2. Eligibility
In order to access and use our Services, you must

- be at least 18 years of age and have the capacity to enter into a legally binding agreement,
- use our Services only for business purposes, and
- establish an Advertiser Account in accordance with Section 3. 

You may not access or use our Services if
- you are prohibited by law from using the Services or do not have the requisite licenses or other governmental authorizations to use the Services,
- you or your country is on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties or countries, or
- your use of the Services breaches any other agreement to which you are a party. 

If you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of another person or entity: references to *"you"* in these Terms collectively refer to you and that person or entity, and you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity's behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.

## 3. Advertiser Account
You can request to establish an Advertiser Account with us by joining https://ads.brave.com/search. You will need to provide us information to establish an Advertiser Account (*"Account Information"*), including your name and email address. We may ask for additional Account Information at our discretion. The Account Information you provide must be true and accurate. You must promptly inform us whenever your Account Information changes.
When you establish your Advertiser Account, we may provide you with information related to the Services which is confidential, and you agree to keep such information confidential. You have confidentiality obligations with respect to this information and these obligations are described in Section 7.
You must maintain the security of your Advertiser Account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Advertiser Account without your permission. If you permit others to use your Advertiser Account, you are responsible for the activities of such people that occur in connection with your Advertiser Account. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact information for your Advertiser Account.
If you wish to delete or deactivate your Advertiser Account, you may do so according to Section 16, but note that we may retain certain information as permitted by law, regulation or court order.

## 4. Advertising Content
You alone are responsible for the ads submitted for the Platform on your Advertiser Account (*"your ads"*). You must ensure that your ads are truthful, not misleading, comply with all applicable laws, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence. Your ads must conform to our ad policy (*"Ad Policy"*), which we provide to you when you establish your Advertiser Account and which is incorporated into these terms. The Ad Policy includes a list of the geographic regions in which Brave Ads are intended to be shown. We may update the Ad Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to review these changes to the Ad Policy on an ongoing basis.
You must accurately label your ads with the region(s) in which they are to be shown, and the subject of each of your ads must be legal to advertise, sell, and use in all of the regions with which you label that ad, as well as in the USA, the state of California, and the Cayman Islands. 
Your ads are subject to review and approval by us before they are activated for delivery in the Platform. We may also review your ads at any point and for any reason. If your ads for any reason do not pass our approval process, or are otherwise deemed to be in violation of these Terms, we may — at our discretion — disable those ads, immediately halt all of your ads, suspend you from the platform, or apply other remedies we think are needed to ensure the quality and reputation of the Platform. Our determination in these matters, including as to which Content Classifications apply to any of your ads, is final and binding.
You grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to Brave to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, and modify (as needed for display on the Platform) your ads for the purpose of displaying your ads via the Platform and otherwise providing the Services to you under these Terms.
Brave reserves the right to suspend campaigns at any time if Brave suspects that the advertiser campaign poses a safety risk to our users including if Brave suspects that the advertising company has a security breach/incident and/or other significant operational failures, provided that Brave will provide as much notice to Advertiser as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances prior to suspending a campaign.
Campaign performance may vary and is not guaranteed by Brave.

## 5. Invoicing & Payment
Your ads are priced based on the number of clicks (*“Clicks”*) the ad generates and the cost per click (*“CPC”*), which is the amount you agree to pay us for each click you receive. The CPC is based either on a fixed price agreed upon between you and us or on a competitive bidding process that takes place at the time an ad is to be served in response to a relevant query. When the Platform displays one of your ads and a user clicks on the ad, it reports that Click to us. Approximately every month, we verify and tally the Clicks and CPC associated with all of your active ad campaigns and issue you an invoice. Our accounting of Clicks and CPC is final and binding. You agree to pay the full amount of each invoice within 30 days of receipt.

## 6. Taxes
You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Services, and for withholding, collecting, reporting and remitting the correct taxes, if any, to the appropriate tax authorities. Brave is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any tax arising from your use of the Services. You agree to provide information reasonably requested by Brave, including completed and signed tax forms, as applicable.

## 7. Confidentiality
In the course of your use of the Services, we may disclose to you information which we consider confidential (*"Confidential Information"*), including information regarding your pricing and performance measures. 
You agree to use this Confidential Information solely for the purpose of using the Platform and to keep this Confidential Information secret, using no less than the same degree of care that you use when you protect your own similar confidential information, and in any event at least a reasonable degree of care.

Please read the following section carefully because it contains additional provisions applicable only to individuals located, resident, or domiciled in the United States.

If you would prefer to send a written complaint via mail, please include as much information as possible in describing your complaint, including your support ticket number, how you would like us to resolve the complaint, and any other relevant information to us at legal@brave.com. The complaint process is completed when Brave responds to your complaint or 45 business days after the date we receive your complaint, whichever occurs first. You agree to complete this process before filing an arbitration demand and agree that that completing the complaint process is a condition precedent to filing an arbitration demand or any other litigation.

### 1. Binding Arbitration.

- (i) waive your and Brave's respective rights to have any and all Disputes resolved in a court, and**
- (ii) waive your and Brave's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Brave will arbitrate disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

### 2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.
Any Dispute is personal to you and Brave and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative or collective proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

### 3. Federal Arbitration Act

### 4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution
Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

- (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number,
- (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and
- (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking.
If you and Brave cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Brave may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 13, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 13.1, file a claim in court.

### 5. Venue & Arbitrator
Any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (*"JAMS Rules"*), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

### 6. Authority of Arbitrator; Exchange of Information; Fees and Costs

- (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and
- (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. For any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee, and Brave will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Brave, Brave will pay all JAMS fees and costs.

- (ii) waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
### 8. Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions
If any term, clause or provision of this Section 13 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 13 will remain valid and enforceable.
### 9. Opt Out
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the Terms by notifying us via email at advertisers@brave.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with section 13.
### 14. Governing Law and Venue
These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflict of law rules that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

### 17. Severability
If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time as reasonably required to comply with applicable law or regulation. You may not assign your rights and obligations under these Terms without our express written consent. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Your access to or use of the Services does not create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar relationship between you and us.
