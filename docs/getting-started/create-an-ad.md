There are two ways to create an ad in Brave Ads Manager:
# During campaign set up
During the campaign creation process, you’ll reach a step called Ads where you’ll see the option to create a new ad. Follow the onscreen instructions, which will provide guidelines on what to enter or upload based on the type of campaign you chose earlier on. This step will also show a preview of your ad to simulate how it will be seen by your audience.
# Independent of any campaign set up
To create an ad outside of a campaign, for example to be used across many campaigns, start from the home screen in Brave Ads Manager and select Creatives from the left sidebar. Once in the ads menu, hit the New Creative button in the top right corner of your screen. Then, choose the placement type that you wish to create an ad for.
